# AngularJS Minesweeper Game
Recreation of the classic Windows game "Minesweeper". Made using Angular 1.8.2. Uses a CDN to reference the Angular library hosted on GoogleAPIs, so no need to download Angular to your machine. Uses an Angular module and it's controller to bind data to the HTML elements and add functionality (clicking a square to reveal if it's a mine or not, determining if the player gets a Game Over, etc.).

## Running The Project

Simply run the "index.html" file in your web browser (preferably Google Chrome, OperaGX, or similar browser).
